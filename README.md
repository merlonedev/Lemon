## Job application test for Lemon Energia

In this repo you will find the test for my job application at Lemon Energia.

The test consisted on creating a simple overlay modal that can be closed via three different ways:
- a close button on it
- pressing ESC on the keyboard
- clicking outside of the modal

For that purpose I've used React created with Vite, Typescript and Sass, along with a couple of addons such as React Switch.

I've had a bit of a tough break when having to deal with the logic for the "click outside to close", however managed to find plenty of tips and help in Stack Overflow. The sources for the inspirations of my solutions are documented via commentaries on the code itself.
